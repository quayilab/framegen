# *Proof of Concept* Initiative
This document is the base of how the product shall be built. It shall contain viable aspects surrounding the background of the motivation and its derivatives (ideas, objectives etc.), including but not limited to problems, solution scenarios, limitations, available supporting technologies and so on. However, to keep the focus and the energy, only a few among the candidates will be emphasized here and to be detailed in derivative documents if necessary. 
## Background
### Change of Behavior
By 2010s Multimedia (VIdeo) streaming is an undeniable distruptor in content delivery media. Thus, reading will no longer favorable activity to acquire content for user. This happened on almost all user activity contexts, be it entertainment, studying or even browsing for information. Today, it's rather difficult to find content which is not including video stream media as option.

### Rise of the Multimedia Streaming Platform Industries
### Monetizeable Contents 
## Motivation
The motivation behind this *proof of concept* is how online video (read: Youtube) publishing channels can be commercially promising. However this *boom* momentum shall not to be expected lasts very long, and further more, the successor momentum also not to be expected to have same impacts. Thus, actions to take benefit from this momentum shall be immediately, effective, fast pace and target focused, yet the effort vs impact shall be measurable and retargettable for pivot if necessary.

This part shall be converted to *vision* statement as the effort officially performed out of the PoC.
## Objective
The objective of this PoC activities is to determine whether the building blocks and their attributes required by the motivation is possible to achieve, whether the whole or subset, how much effort required etc., and how much flexible to retarget incase of pivot. 

After answering above questions, the next objective is to determine what are the best solution, including audience target, productivity level, engagement efforts, production tools etc.

For the sake of simplifying next step, the following  is the list of objective to put efforts on:
1. **Market research**
   1. To determine how is the video streaming market segmented by viewer attributes (age, education, social statuses, etc.)
   2. To select market segments with the justification
2. **Content production resources, tooling and technology**
   1. To determine tooling and technology for producing the determined contents
   2. To determine the mechanisms to prepare the tooling and technology
   3. To determine the resources to be involved in the production
3. **Time and cost**
   1. To determine the cost of content production
   2. To determine the cost of non-production operation
   3. To determine the time needed for unit production 
4. **Operation**
   1. To determine milestones of the video streaming channel
   2. To determine content to be delivered along with their functionalities
   3. To determine delivery media and pattern
   4. To determine metrics and achievement target
5. **Finance**
   1. To determine Break Event Point
   2. To perform periodical forcast
6. **Marketing and Commercials**
   1. To determine the *branding* items
   2. To determine additional marketing effort
7. **Further developments**
   1. To determine non-video streaming digital business line
   2. To determine non-digital business line

This part shall then be part of the *mission* statement.
