# Design
This document is the base of how the product shall be built. It shall contain viable aspects surrounding the background of the motivation and its derivatives (ideas, objectives etc.), including but not limited to problems, solution scenarios, limitations, available supporting technologies and so on. However, to keep the focus and the energy, only a few among the candidates will be emphasized here and to be detailed in derivative documents if necessary. 
## Motivation
The motivation behind this *proof of concept* is how online video (read: Youtube) publishing channels can be commercially promising. However this *boom* momentum shall not to be expected lasts very long, and further more, the successor momentum also not to be expected to have same impacts. Thus, actions to take benefit from this momentum shall be immediately, effective, fast pace and target focused, yet the effort vs impact shall be measurable and retargettable for pivot if necessary.

This part shall be converted to *vision* statement as the effort officially performed out of the PoC.
## Objective
The objective of this PoC activities is to determine whether the building blocks and their attributes required by the motivation is possible to achieve, whether the whole or subset, how much effort required etc., and how much flexible to retarget incase of pivot. 

After answering above questions, the next objective is to determine what are the best solution, including audience target, productivity level, engagement efforts, production tools etc.

This part shall then be part of the *mission* statement.
