# Software Requirements and Specification
## Motivation
The motivation of this document refers to document `document-name` part `document part`.
## Objective
The objective of this document is to provide technical requirements for software development which is measurable and can be used as reference which resulting deterministic software mechanism. 

The requirement shall state the expected functionalities which is specific for a set of specific input and produced output with a set of specifications.

The format of the requirement shall be in form of the following (this is the requirements requirements):
1. Requirement shall has paragraph of wording which may help developer to understand the background of the functionality.
2. After the wording, requirement shall display one or more diagrams which can be flow-chart, use case diagram, input-process-output diagram, cause/effect matrices or other diagram.
3. Requirement shall also have explanation along with the diagram(s) with the format:
   1. Input atomic parameter explanation, what shall be covered (in-scope) and what shall not be covered (out-scope).
   2. process explanation, what shall be covered (in-scope) and what shall not be covered (out-scope).
   3. Output atomic parameter explanation, what shall be covered (in-scope) and what shall not be covered (out-scope).
   4. Side effect explanation, what will be affected and what not to be affected.
   5. How this functionality is accessed (by user or by othe system/sub-system), including options of the access, for example: function add user can be accessed via command line interface or via web-based interface.
   6. Provide real world example of the functionality. 

the development is to build a set of software which helping video streaming chanel maintenance to:
